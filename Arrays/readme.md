# What are Arrays
- called list 
- order items sequence
- item are one after another 
- **one of the most widely used**
- go for one item at the time it is the best choice
- array uses constant time one. 
- some of the array methods are lookup,push,insert and delete 
- [Code Section](../Arrays/simpleArray.js)

###Arrays does the following operation
-Create
- Update
-Edit 
-Delete

# There are two types of arrays 
1. Unordered Arrays - arrays are not in order 
 - fast insertion means u can enter really quick
 - search slowest as it will have to go through each data one step at a time
```
a = [1,99,22,33]

```
- will have to go through each one of them one at a time to find the data. 


2. Ordered Arrays 
  - array in order could be based on highest to lowest or vice versa 
 - searching very fast (uses [BinarySearch](https://github.com/IshtiaqueNafis/datastructuresandalgorithms/tree/master/Arrays/Searching%20Algorithims/BinarySearch))
 
```
a= [1,2,3,4,5] 
```
- in here all the elements are completely in order from lowest to highest thus this is a
