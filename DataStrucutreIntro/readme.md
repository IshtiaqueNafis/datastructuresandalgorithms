#What is Data structure?

- data structure is a collection of values 
    - vales had relationship with each other 
    - have functions apply with them (functions have specific task) 
  ```
  public boolean addItem(int number) {
       if(numItems>maxItems) return false;
       arrayData[numItems] = number;
       numItems++;
       return true;
   }

   public void printItems(){
       System.out.println("Items in the array");
       for (int i = 0; i <numItems ; i++) {
           System.out.println(arrayData[i]);
       }
       System.out.println("");
   } 

  ```
  - two different function here one works with adding item other with printing array values
    
- file cabinet of different types each structure is good for different things. 


  

- helps organize data. 
- put things and take things
- can store things like number, boolean and objects

##Two important things in Data structure
- how to build one
  - how do would you built a solution to a problem
  - this could be like writing sudo code when you write down steps.   
- how to use it 
  - some structure might be better for other cases

##Some popular data Structure Algorithm 
Terms |Definition  |
--- | --------  | 
*Insertion*| `Add new item in a given collection of tiem ` | 
*Deletion*| `Remove data ` | 
*Traversal*| `Acess each data item once so it can be processed` | 
*searching*| `Find the data collection Item` | 
*Sorting*| `sorting based on highest or lowest`
